# Second-order-optimization
***
* This repo contain FBGS Implementation for second order optimizers <br>
* In this notbook, first test my data with gradient descent, then Newton's method <br>
* Finally, made implementation of BFGS Quasi method. and test mt data, then see what difference between GD, Newton'method and BFGS
